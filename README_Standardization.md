# Standardization in Machine Learning

This notebook explains how and why to perform **Standardization**, a data preprocessing technique used to rescale features.

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Introduction to feature scaling
- Using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`
- Code walkthrough and results
- Comparison of raw vs. standardized features

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Run the notebook cell by cell.
2. Ensure your dataset is correctly loaded.
3. Understand the output differences.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Standardize?

Some machine learning models are sensitive to the scale of features. Standardization transforms your data to have:
- Mean = 0
- Standard Deviation = 1

This helps models converge faster and improves prediction accuracy.
